# privacy-amplification-code
a FPGA implementation of a privacy amplification based on Cellular Automata, writing with verilog.
it contains six modules, including ROM control module (ROM itself hasno code, just ip design in vivado), CA module, dispatch module, one of four module, calculation module and accumulation module.


if you want to learn more about this privacy amplification based on CA, you could read this paper and its reference[1].
